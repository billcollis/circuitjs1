# CircuitJS1

## Introduction

CircuitJS1 is an electronic circuit simulator that runs in the browser. It was originally written by Paul Falstad as a Java Applet. It was adapted by Iain Sharp to run in the browser using GWT.

For a hosted version of the application see:

I have written an API for Paul's wonderful simulator, and have embedded it into my GECKO platform at gecko3.azurewebsites.net
